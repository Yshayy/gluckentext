Glückentext
===========

A language-learning cloze app written in scala on Android with [scaloid](https://github.com/pocorall/scaloid/). Glückentext can be [downloaded from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gluckentext).

This app finds random articles in Wikipedia, replaces pre-specified words with blanks, and lets the user fill in the blanks.

![Learn languages with Glückentext - the app ____ turns Wikipedia into a word-completion quiz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9982020/5462977/694d0354-8581-11e4-945b-9f6b7c00f470.png)

I'm using this app as an exercise to practice:

* functional programming
* scala
* scaloid
* scalatest with flatspec
